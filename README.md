# Sliding Effect

A single view application that uses UIKitDynamics to implement a nice sliding animation inspired by Apple's notification center.

The UIDynamicBehavior subclass contains the following behaviors:

- UICollisionBehavior
- UIDynamicItemBehavior
- UIGravityBehavior

.. which, grouped together, will create our sliding behavior.
